PROJECT INFORMATION/DETAILS :
-----------------------------

BACK-END :

Framework used : Django (Python) as Application Server
Web Server : Heroku / Apache (Most probably Heroku)
Database : SQLite (relational DBMS) / MongoDB (non-relational DBMS)

FRONT-END :

Basic HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT/BOOTSTRAP/JQUERY etc. (for designing website structure and adding Dynamics) 
No React/React-Native etc.

App Type :

Basically WEB-App running on PCs & Laptops (or any device running Web Browsers eg.Chrome/Mozilla Firefox etc.)
If needed will convert to Progressive Web App (PWA) for Mobile/Tablet devices
No Android Studio/Flutter etc.

Abstract :
//////////
Our Project is a derived version/inspired from the Problem Statement aspiring for the Aqua App (TM).
But with some added functionalities and "not being an Android app" we do not follow the actual structuring/idea of the original app.

We are aiming to develop an app for Agriculture sector/Agro industries.
The aim of the app is to manage the supply and distribution of water & fertilizers to farms in India and some other facilities.
It will first of all maintain a Datbase of all its customers (farmers) as well as operators who control the app to serve the customer + an Admin's Login.
The features available to all of these will vary in the app as they Login into the server/Database.
The app aims to analyze the quality of land/type of weather/type of crop/nutrients in soil etc. and then recommend the best fertilizers and adequate quantity of water.
The analyzation part can be done by a Surveyor who goes with his equipments and conducts tests/measures land size etc. and creates an ID for farmers and feeds the data in the Database.
The app will also be able to control the supply of water and will calculate the bill accordingly.
We also aim to develop and connect IoT devices (or atleast form a miniature model) to Water Supply motors etc. which can be controlled from the app.

Apart from this we have some additional functionalities like :
Developing a recommendation system based on weather/sunlight and data from the Database to predict the type of crop best to be grown in that condition/season.
Also we will have a mobile messaging as well as notification system telling farmers about Daily Weather updates/Market prices of the crops they grow/etc.
We also aim to have a blog station where experts write about informed ways of farming and recommending crops that require less but fetch more money etc.
The farmers can even declare the crops and the prices at which they want to sell on their portals by themselves or by contacting their regional managers (of App) etc.
